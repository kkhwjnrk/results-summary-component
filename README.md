# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component 👨‍💻🔍

![Preview](./design/preview.png)

This project is my solution to the Results Summary Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build a responsive webpage.

I built this project using mobile-first design principles and used HTML and SCSS for the layout and styling. To display the data on the webpage, I also used JavaScript.
